<h2 id="what-is-octopress">What is Octopress?</h2>
<p>Octopress is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blogging at its finest.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Octopress sports a clean responsive theme</strong> written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Code blogging is easy and beautiful.</strong> Embed code (with <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.</li>
<li><strong>Third party integration is simple</strong> with built-in support for Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.</li>
<li><strong>It's easy to use.</strong> A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.</li>
<li><strong>Ships with great plug-ins</strong> some original and others from the Jekyll community &#8212; tested and improved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Octopress requires a minimum Ruby version of <code>1.9.3-p0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Check out <a href="http://octopress.org/docs">Octopress.org</a> for guides and documentation. It should all apply to our current stable version (found in the <code>master</code> branch). If this is not the case, <a href="https://github.com/octopress/docs">please submit a fix to our docs repo</a>.</p>

<p>We love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report, feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins">list of 3rd party plug-ins</a>, where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories. For the future, we're thinking about ways to easier add them into our main releases.</p>
